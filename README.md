## My vim setup for all of my development

I am creating this file as, for various reasons, it looks like I will need to fall back from VSCode to Vim. I have
casually used Vim in the past, but my sense is this will be a more long term use and needs to be properly setup to meet
my day-to-day needs.

### Goals:
  - [ ] To highlight in all of the languages (I'm sorry, I always cringe when Html and CSS are included in languages as well) I use and need
    - [ ] Haskell
    - [ ] Elm
    - [ ] Javascript
    - [ ] Python
    - [ ] Elixir
    - [ ] HTML
    - [ ] CSS
  - [ ] To lint in all the languages required
  - [ ] File tree
  - [ ] Auto-formatting where a language supports it
  - [ ] The basics to make it usable
